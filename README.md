# STAT 545B Assignment B1: Grace Melchers

This repository contains a .Rmd file that contains the code for a new function that I made for Assignment B1 for the STAT 545B course at UBC.

This function is titled `summarize_obs_by_var_group()` and was designed for quick summarizing of a variable with a numeric vector in a dataframe by the different groups of a variable with character vectors. The need for this function arose in a previous assignment, the Mini Data Analysis for STAT 545A.
